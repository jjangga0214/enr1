### conversation 2
물론 우리 교재에서 `과거시제`와 `과거진행`에 포커스를 맞추고 있지만, 조금 더 확장해보면 어떨까 싶어. 아래 강조 표시한 것처럼 *have been studying* - 과거부터 현재까지 studying 해오고 있음 - 같이 `현재 완료 진행`이나 *wanna* -want to 의 줄임말- 같은 `은어`, *That's why*같은 `관용적 표현` 등을 원래 표현하려 했던 `과거시제`나 `과거진행` [여기선 **was studying**] 과 같이 표현해 준다면 꿩먹고 알먹고 일수도 있을것 같아~
